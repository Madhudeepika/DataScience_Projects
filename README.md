#Project Title: Medical Inventory Optimization & Forecasting

Project Description:
This project focuses on addressing the notable surge in bounce rates within the healthcare system, adversely affecting patient satisfaction. The aim is to optimize medical inventory levels to minimize bounce rates while keeping inventory costs at a minimum.

Key Features:

Data Preprocessing: Explore and preprocess historical data to ensure accuracy in forecasting.

SARIMAX Model Implementation: Implement SARIMAX models for future bounce rate predictions.

Streamlit Model Deployment: Utilize Streamlit for real-time processing and transparent display of forecasted values and dates.

Data Visualization: Enhance comprehension with line charts and histograms to facilitate effective decision-making.

Continuous Monitoring: Ensure continuous monitoring and feedback for iterative improvements and validation of strategies.

Objective:
The primary objective of this project is to achieve a minimum 30% reduction in bounce rates and drive a revenue increase of at least 20 lacs INR through effective inventory optimization.

Project Scope:

Analyze historical bounce rates and key contributing factors.

Explore and preprocess relevant data for accurate forecasting.

Implement SARIMAX models for future bounce rate predictions.

Optimize inventory levels to align with forecasted demand.

Enhance patient experience through streamlined operations.

Conclusion:
The forecasted values provide promising insights into the effectiveness of the implemented strategies in minimizing bounce rates and optimizing inventory costs. Continuous monitoring and assessment will be crucial to validate the actual impact on bounce rates and economic success. Further data analysis and stakeholder feedback will enhance the depth of our understanding and validate the success of the implemented strategies.
